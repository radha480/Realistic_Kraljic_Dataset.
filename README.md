#Overview

The Kraljic Portfolio Analysis is a strategic procurement tool that helps organizations classify their products or materials based on two key factors — Supply Risk and Profit Impact. This project aims to analyze supplier and product data to determine the best sourcing strategy for each product category. By using this framework, companies can optimize their supply chain, minimize risk, and maximize profitability.

#Problem Statement

Organizations often face challenges in managing suppliers and products with varying levels of risk, cost, and strategic importance. Without a structured approach, procurement teams may fail to identify which products require long-term partnerships or which can be sourced competitively. This project solves that issue by applying the Kraljic Matrix model to classify items into: Leverage Items Strategic Items Non-critical Items Bottleneck Items

#Dataset The dataset contains product-level information relevant to supplier management and risk evaluation. It includes the following key columns:

Column Name Description Product_ID Unique identifier for each product Product_Name Name or description of the product Supplier_Region Geographical region of the supplier Lead_Time_Days Average time taken for delivery Order_Volume_Units Quantity ordered per cycle Cost_per_Unit Cost of one unit of the product Supply_Risk_Score Numeric score representing supply chain risk (1–10) Profit_Impact_Score Score indicating profit contribution (1–10) Environmental_Impact Impact score based on sustainability Single_Source_Risk Binary or score showing dependency on one supplier Kraljic_Category Final classification according to the matri

#Tools & Technologies This project uses a combination of data analytics and visualization tools to perform portfolio analysis: Python – for data manipulation and analysis Pandas & NumPy – for handling and processing data Plotly & Matplotlib – for visualizing risk vs. profit matrix Streamlit – for building an interactive dashboard Scikit-learn – for scaling, clustering, or risk modeling (if applied) Jupyter Notebook – for exploratory data analysis (EDA)

#Key Insights Products with high Supply Risk and high Profit Impact fall into the Strategic category — requiring partnership and careful management. Leverage items offer high profit but low risk — suitable for competitive sourcing. Bottleneck items pose risk due to supply constraints despite low profit impact — need contingency planning. Non-critical items are low in both risk and impact — can be standardized and automated for efficiency. The Supplier Region analysis helps identify high-risk areas or regions with longer lead times. Cost analysis highlights potential savings through better supplier negotiation for high-volume products.

#Conclusion The Kraljic Portfolio Analysis provides a structured, data-driven way to improve supply chain strategy. By segmenting products based on risk and profit impact, organizations can: Focus efforts on strategic partnerships, Reduce supply chain vulnerabilities, Optimize cost efficiency
